Back End
-------------

- create states within room objects where 0 is option phase and 1 is voting phase.
  If in phase 0, voting cannot be done and only options and the ability to add them are displayed.
  If in phase 1, ability to add options disappears and users can now vote.
  Only creators of a poll can change the state of a poll!!
